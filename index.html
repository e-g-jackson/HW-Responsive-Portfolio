            <p>Erik Jackson is a future web developer based out of Saint Paul, Minnesota. Most of his time is spent working as a manager in a restaurant, but would like to move on to something else someday soon. In his spare time he likes playing guitar, riding bikes and listening to music; one day, he will actually have time to do these things.</p>
            <p>Recently, Erik enrolled in the UMN Code Bootcamp for Web Development! Although he has previously dabbled in coding with Python and HTML, he still has a lot to learn! He is currently learning to program in CSS, and Javascript with more to come soon!</p>
            <p>Eventually, Erik would like to use these skills to develop web pages and applications and maybe even get paid for it!</p>
